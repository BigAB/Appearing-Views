Appearing-Views
===============

A sub class of UIView that animates "in" to view and "out" of view, and broadcasts to the delegate and notification center that it is about to do so when it does.

##TO DO:
- [ ] Add Custom Animations Example
- [ ] Make it so you can have different Animations/Durations/Options on Appearing and Disappearing
- [ ] Allow reversing an animation partway through (appearing -> no you don't disappear now -> okay I'll go)
